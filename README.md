Idea:

A project opener and saver, like the 'recently opened option' but better.

Flow:

$ projectrs project_name
-> opens project_name with vscode

$ projectrs project_name --nvim/-n
-> opens project_name with neovim

$ projectrs add
-> stores the current directory

$ projectrs add codethings/rust/example
-> marks that folder

Considerations

-   [ ] two projects with the same name
-   [ ] remove/rename directories
-   [ ] autocomplete for opening
-   [ ] autocomplete filtering
-   [ ] autocomplete for adding directories
-   [ ]
